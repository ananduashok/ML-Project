# ML Assignment 5: Clustering Algorithm - Explanation

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to apply clustering techniques to the **Iris dataset** and analyze how different clustering methods group the data points. Two clustering methods—**KMeans Clustering** and **Hierarchical Clustering**—are implemented and compared.

## Dataset
The **Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets` is used. It contains numerical features representing measurements of iris flowers. Since this is a clustering problem, the **species column is dropped**, and the focus is on grouping similar data points.

## Key Steps in the Notebook

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
- The dataset is loaded using `load_iris()` from `sklearn`.
- The feature columns are stored in a Pandas DataFrame.
- Basic information and summary statistics are displayed to understand data distribution.
- **StandardScaler** is applied to normalize the data, improving clustering efficiency.

### 2. KMeans Clustering
- **KMeans Clustering** is applied to group data into three clusters.
- A **scatter plot** visualizes the clusters based on two principal features.

#### Why KMeans?
- KMeans is efficient for numerical data like the Iris dataset.
- It minimizes intra-cluster variance, making it a suitable choice for well-separated clusters.

### 3. Hierarchical Clustering
- **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering** is applied.
- A **dendrogram** is plotted to visualize the clustering hierarchy.

#### Why Hierarchical Clustering?
- Hierarchical clustering helps visualize relationships among data points.
- It does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance.

### 4. Visualization & Conclusion
- Both **KMeans and Hierarchical clustering** results are compared visually.
- The dendrogram provides insights into how data points are merged into clusters.
- The clustering results help analyze **how well the models separate different iris species.**
