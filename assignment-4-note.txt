ML Assignment 4: Classification Problem - Explanation
Objective
The goal of this notebook is to apply supervised learning techniques to classify breast cancer data using various classification algorithms. The performance of these models is compared to determine the best approach for this dataset.
Dataset
The Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets is used. It contains numerical features extracted from breast cancer biopsies, along with a binary target variable indicating whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
Key Steps in the Notebook
1. Data Loading & Exploration
•	The dataset is loaded using load_breast_cancer() from sklearn.
•	It is converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easier handling.
•	Basic information and summary statistics are displayed to understand data distribution.
2. Data Preprocessing
•	Missing values are checked (none found in this dataset).
•	Feature scaling is performed using StandardScaler to normalize the data and improve model performance.
•	The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
3. Classification Models Implemented
Five different classification models are trained and evaluated:
1.	Logistic Regression - A statistical model used for binary classification.
2.	Decision Tree Classifier - A tree-based model that splits data based on feature thresholds.
3.	Random Forest Classifier - An ensemble model that improves accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
4.	Support Vector Machine (SVM) - A powerful classifier that finds the best decision boundary.
5.	k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) - A simple distance-based classification model.
4. Model Evaluation & Comparison
•	Each model is trained on the training set and tested on the test set.
•	Evaluation metrics include Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix.
•	The results are compared, and a bar plot visualization is generated to display model performance.
5. Conclusion
•	The accuracy of all models is compared.
•	The best and worst-performing models are identified based on accuracy and other metrics.
•	The overall classification analysis is completed successfully.
