# ML Assignment 3: Regression

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to evaluate regression techniques in supervised learning by applying them to a real-world dataset. The assignment involves implementing multiple regression models, comparing their performance, and analyzing the results.

## Dataset
The California Housing dataset from the `sklearn` library is used for this assignment. This dataset contains information about various housing features in California and their respective median prices.

## Key Components

### 1. Loading and Preprocessing
- The dataset is loaded using the `fetch_california_housing` function from `sklearn`.
- Converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling.
- Checked for missing values and performed necessary feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).

### 2. Regression Algorithms Implemented
The following regression models were implemented:
1. **Linear Regression** - A simple model assuming a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables.
2. **Decision Tree Regressor** - A tree-based model that splits the data based on feature conditions.
3. **Random Forest Regressor** - An ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees for improved performance.
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor** - A boosting technique that sequentially improves weak models.
5. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)** - Uses support vector machines for regression tasks.

Each model was trained and tested on the dataset.

### 3. Model Evaluation
Each model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.
- **R-squared Score (R²)**: Indicates how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable.

### 4. Results and Comparison
- The performance of all models is compared based on evaluation metrics.
- A bar plot visualization is used to compare the R² scores of different models.
- The best-performing and worst-performing models are identified with justifications.

## How to Run the Code
1. Install necessary libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`.
2. Run the script in a Jupyter Notebook or Python environment.
3. The results, including evaluation metrics and visualizations, will be displayed.

## Conclusion
This assignment provided insights into different regression techniques and their effectiveness in predicting house prices. The best model was identified based on evaluation metrics, offering a deeper understanding of regression analysis.
